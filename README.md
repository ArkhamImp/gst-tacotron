# GST Tacotron

A tensorflow implementation of the [Style Tokens: Unsupervised Style Modeling, Control and Transfer in End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09017) and [Towards End-to-End Prosody Transfer for Expressive Speech Synthesis with Tacotron](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09047).

## Todo:
- [x] Update the attention mechanism for global style attention paper [Style Tokens: Unsupervised Style Modeling, Control and Transfer in End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09017)
- [ ] Add GMM-attention for the paper [Towards End-to-End Prosody Transfer for Expressive Speech Synthesis with Tacotron](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09047).
- [ ] Evaluation process and demos
- [ ] Usage for this repo.
- [ ] Multi-speaker model

## Notes:
There are some important changes to this repo, we will push these changes to github after we get experimental results.
